# üß± What is System Design?

---

**System Design** is the process of **defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow** of a software system to meet specified functional and non-functional requirements.

It bridges the gap between **high-level user/business needs** and **low-level engineering implementation**, creating blueprints for how a scalable, maintainable, and performant software system should behave.

Think of it like:

* Architecture is to buildings what system design is to software.
* You don't just build code ‚Äî you **design systems that run and scale reliably**.

## üí° What It Involves

System Design includes:

| Area                            | Involves                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Requirements**     | What features the system must support                         |
| **Non-functional Requirements** | Scale, availability, latency, cost, maintainability           |
| **Component Design**            | Breaking down into logical pieces (APIs, databases, services) |
| **Data Flow**                   | How data moves across components                              |
| **Communication Design**        | How services interact (HTTP, gRPC, queues)                    |
| **Storage Design**              | What to store where and how (SQL, NoSQL, Cache, etc.)         |
| **Scalability Considerations**  | Sharding, partitioning, autoscaling                           |
| **Failure Recovery**            | What happens when a component crashes                         |
| **Security & Auth**             | Who can access what? With what permissions?                   |
| **Deployment**                  | How the system is deployed (cloud, containers, etc.)          |

## üìå Real-World Analogy

Imagine designing **Amazon.com‚Äôs shopping cart**:

* You need a service to hold the cart (state).
* Users might add/remove items (APIs).
* What if the cart server crashes?
* What if 100M users are shopping at once?
* Should we use a database, or a cache?
* How fast should the system respond?
* How to deploy it in multiple regions?

That‚Äôs all system design.

## üßë‚Äçüíº Interview-Focused

* Break down the **problem clearly**
* Show **design thinking**
* Make trade-offs explicit
* Justify choices with **real-world patterns**

## üß∞ Types of System Design

| Type                          | What It Covers                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-Level Design (HLD)**   | Architecture, services, APIs, communication protocols |
| **Low-Level Design (LLD)**    | Class diagrams, method design, database schema        |
| **Distributed System Design** | Scalable and fault-tolerant design for large systems  |

For most interviews and real-world scalable systems, we focus on **High-Level + Distributed Design**.

## üîÅ Iterative Design Process

1. **Clarify Requirements** ‚Äì Ask detailed questions
2. **Define APIs** ‚Äì Inputs, outputs, use cases
3. **Design Data Models** ‚Äì ER diagrams, schemas
4. **Sketch Architecture** ‚Äì Components, communication
5. **Consider Scale** ‚Äì Horizontal/vertical scaling
6. **Handle Failures** ‚Äì Redundancy, retries, monitoring
7. **Optimize** ‚Äì Caching, async flows, rate limiting
8. **Discuss Trade-offs** ‚Äì Simplicity vs performance
