# Proxy vs Reverse Proxy

## Introduction
Proxies and reverse proxies are intermediary servers that enhance security, privacy, and performance in network communication.

- A **Proxy Server (Forward Proxy)** acts on behalf of clients, forwarding requests to the internet.
- A **Reverse Proxy** acts on behalf of servers, managing incoming requests before they reach backend servers.

This document covers the differences between these two, real-world applications, and a simple setup using **Nginx**.

## 1. What is a Proxy Server?
A **proxy server** (also called a **forward proxy**) is an intermediary that relays client requests to external servers. It hides the client’s identity while allowing controlled internet access.

### How it Works:
1. The client sends a request to access a website.
2. The proxy server intercepts the request and decides whether to:
   - Forward it to the destination
   - Block it
   - Serve a cached response
3. If forwarded, the destination server only sees the proxy's IP address.
4. The destination responds, and the proxy relays the response to the client.

### **Benefits of Proxy Servers**
✅ **Privacy & Anonymity:** Hides the user’s real IP.
✅ **Access Control:** Enforces browsing restrictions (e.g., corporate policies).
✅ **Security:** Filters malicious content and blocks harmful sites.
✅ **Performance Optimization:** Caches frequently requested content.

### **Example Use Cases**
1. **Bypassing Geographic Restrictions**  
   - Streaming platforms provide region-specific content.
   - Using a proxy in another country allows access to content unavailable in your region.

2. **Caching for Faster Access**  
   - Organizations use caching proxies to store frequently accessed web pages.
   - This reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up access.

## 2. What is a Reverse Proxy?
A **reverse proxy** is an intermediary between clients and backend servers. It manages traffic, improves security, and optimizes performance.

### How it Works:
1. A user sends a request to access a website.
2. The **reverse proxy** receives the request first.
3. It determines the best backend server to handle the request.
4. The backend server processes the request and responds.
5. The reverse proxy forwards the response back to the client.

### **Benefits of Reverse Proxy**
✅ **Enhanced Security:** Hides backend servers, reducing attack risks.
✅ **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
✅ **Caching Static Content:** Stores assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript.
✅ **SSL Termination:** Manages SSL encryption, offloading this from backend servers.
✅ **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Blocks malicious requests before reaching servers.

### **Real-World Example**
- **Cloudflare’s Reverse Proxy** provides security, caching, and load balancing.
- It blocks malicious traffic and accelerates content delivery through edge caching.

## 3. Setting Up a Reverse Proxy with Nginx
One of the most popular tools for reverse proxying is **Nginx**. Below is a basic setup guide.

### **Step 1: Install Nginx**
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### **Step 2: Configure Reverse Proxy**
Edit the Nginx configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) and add the following:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server_ip;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### **Step 3: Test and Restart Nginx**
```sh
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## 4. Load Balancing with Nginx
For high-traffic applications, a reverse proxy can distribute requests across multiple servers using different load-balancing algorithms.

### **Example: Load Balancing Configuration**
```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
    ip_hash;
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```
### **Load Balancing Algorithms:**
- **Round Robin (default)** – Distributes requests equally.
- **Least Connections** – Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
- **IP Hash** – Directs requests from the same client IP to the same backend server.

## 5. Summary
| Feature           | Proxy Server (Forward Proxy) | Reverse Proxy |
|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Acts on behalf of | Clients (users) | Servers |
| Purpose | Hides client identity, controls access | Hides server identity, optimizes requests |
| Security | Protects clients from malicious sites | Protects servers from attacks |
| Load Balancing | ❌ Not applicable | ✅ Distributes traffic |
| Caching | ✅ Can cache responses | ✅ Can cache static content |
| Example Use | VPN, corporate firewalls | Cloudflare, AWS ALB |

## 6. Conclusion
Both **proxy servers** and **reverse proxies** are critical in networking and cybersecurity.

- **Use a proxy server** when you want to control and secure outbound client requests.
- **Use a reverse proxy** when you want to protect backend servers and optimize traffic flow.
