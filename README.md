# BrainDump-CS 🧠💻  

A little corner of the internet where I dump everything I learn in tech—concepts, code snippets, random insights, and things I find cool. No structure, just pure learning chaos. 🚀  

## 🌱 What’s here?  
- CS concepts I pick up along the way  
- Code snippets, debugging wisdom & “oh, that’s how it works!” moments  
- Notes on system design, DSA, and whatever tech I’m exploring  
- Anything worth remembering (or forgetting and rediscovering later)  

## 🤷 Why?  
Because memory is unreliable, but markdown isn’t.
